### 🧠 Who Am I?

</div>

I’m a **Software Engineering and Mechanical Engineering student** with a strong interest in learning new technologies and solving challenging problems. I regularly practice **problem solving on LeetCode** and enjoy turning theoretical knowledge into **real, working projects**.

Currently, I’m focused on building **fun and engaging applications** that help me apply and deepen my understanding of:

- 🌐 Full-stack development with the **MERN stack**
- ⚙️ **C++** for performance-oriented and system-level programming
- 🤖 **Python** for automation, scripting, and tooling

I value clean design, logical thinking, and code that actually does something useful.
